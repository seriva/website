          <p>
            Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of the web. I'm Luuk van Venrooij, 
            and I live and breathe code—both at work and in my spare time.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Over the years, I've had my hands in everything from building game engines 
            and mobile apps (Android & iOS) to developing large-scale industrial asset 
            management systems. I spent some great years as a full-time open-source 
            developer working on the 
            <a href="https://github.com/hitachienergy/epiphany" rel="noopener noreferrer">Epiphany Platform</a>—an 
            industrialized automation platform for Kubernetes and its ecosystem. These days, 
            I'm in a senior architecture role where I design and build cloud infrastructure 
            across AWS, Azure, and GCP.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            When I'm not working, you'll find me tinkering with graphics and game development 
            using OpenGL and WebGL. This site showcases some of those passion projects. 
            I'm also a bit of a hardware enthusiast, so who knows—maybe I'll dive into 
            electronics and IoT projects down the road!
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Got questions, ideas, or just want to chat? Feel free to 
            <a href="#" onclick="javascript:Email()" aria-label="Contact Luuk via email">reach out</a>—I'd 
            love to hear from you.
          </p>
