Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of the web. I'm Luuk van Venrooij, and I live and breathe code—both at work and in my spare time.

Over the years, I've had my hands in everything from building game engines and mobile apps (Android & iOS) to developing large-scale industrial asset management systems. I spent some great years as a full-time open-source developer working on the [Epiphany Platform](https://github.com/hitachienergy/epiphany)—an industrialized automation platform for Kubernetes and its ecosystem. These days, I'm in a senior architecture role where I design and build cloud infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

When I'm not working, you'll find me tinkering with graphics and game development using OpenGL and WebGL. This site showcases some of those passion projects. I'm also a bit of a hardware enthusiast, so who knows—maybe I'll dive into electronics and IoT projects down the road!

Got questions, ideas, or just want to chat? Feel free to [reach out](javascript:void(0))—I'd love to hear from you.
