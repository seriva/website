It has been a while since my last post so I though I would post a quick status update:)

## Genesis Device 2007

I recently decided to start moving away from Windows in favor of Linux on my private machines. Because of this I thought it would be fun to revisit GD2007 and do some work to make it run properly on Linux. Most of the changes required were simple shader, library and build fixes.

If you want to give it a spin I suggest building the project from source using the latest Lazarus/freepascal compiler for your distro. If you are using a debian based distro you can use the included [debian-dependancies.sh](https://github.com/seriva/GenesisDevice-2007/blob/master/Bin/debian-dependancies.sh) script to install all required build/runtime dependencies.

## QDFPA

### Pure ES6 update

In my last [post](https://www.luukvanvenrooij.nl/post/2019-02-19/) I described how I switched completely to ES6 and my way of dealing with non ES6 module formats. Now fast forward a few months and a project called [Pika](https://www.pika.dev/about/) does exactly what I was looking for regarding non ES6 modules. Its still a little rough arround the edges but so it works really well and I moved .

So if you are also looking to simplify your toolchain and move away from transpilers/bundlers to pure ES6 definitely check this out.

### Gamepad support

I was cleaning out a drawer and found an old Bluetooth gamepad. The API for using gamepads with [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API/Using_the_Gamepad_API) is really straight forward so I added support for this in a boring afternoon. Just connect your gamepad and QDFPA should pick it up automaticly. So far only mouselook and WASD movement have been implemented so menus will still require a mouse or touch.

That is it for now! Expect some more updates arround QDFPA soon!
