## New website

After running my site for more then 10 years on [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) I decided to move over to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) in this new year! The main reason beeing that it will be easier to manage and maintain. I have been running my own server for almost 9 years and I had to re-install and restore Wordpress several times after server issues or changes and its just a pain. Added benefits will be that my server will be more secure and will have less operating overhead since with Hugo it`s just serving static files. The only downside was that I was unable to move the posts over from my wordpress site.

## New project

Additionally I have decided to halt all work on my projects except [Cubetastic](https://www.luukvanvenrooij.nl/project/cubetastic/) moving forward. It is going to be a simple FPS arena shooter with Minecraft like destructable maps which should make for some interesting gameplay!:)

That`s it for now but expect more new things soon!
