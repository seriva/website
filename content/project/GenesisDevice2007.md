## About

This project was started in early 2007 and was insprired by the Elder Scrolls: Oblivion. The goal was to create a game engine capable of rendering large outdoor environments like Oblivion. While I never managed to create anything close to a full fledged game engine it served as a good learning project for mastering OpenGL and homing my skills.

In 2010 I decided to [restart](https://www.luukvanvenrooij.nl/project/genesisdevice2010/) the project from scratch to adress some of the main issues like a lack of propper content creation tools and the general engine design limitations.

In recent years I revisited this project several times cleaning up the code and adding some new features for nostagic reasons;)

Currently all work on this project has stopped and it will not be updated anymore.

## Features

* Multi-layered heightmap based terrain
* Water with reflection, refraction, waves and underwater effects
* Foliage (grass, trees, bushes) with animations
* Skydome with clouds and animations
* Octree based scene management
* Forward lighting system with support for 1 directional light with projective soft shadowmaps.
* Modular shader system
* FXAA and SSAO post processing effects
* Multi-platform using SDL
* OpenAL based sound system
* Newton based physics system
* OpenGL based rendering system
