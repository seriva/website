## About

This project was started as a rewrite of [Genesis Device 2007](https://www.luukvanvenrooij.nl/project/genesisdevice2007/) to adress the lack of content creation tools and some general engine design limitations.

During working on it I put the main focus on the supporting a fixed set of content fileformats, the map editor and a new defered renderer. After 4 months of development I stopped development do to lack of time.

Currently all work on this project has stopped and it will not be updated anymore.

## Features

* Custom editor for building maps
* Fixed set of well known content formats (MD5, OBJ and DDS) 
* Text based custom formats for maps and materials
* OpenGL based defered renderer with support for spot and pointlight and soft shadows
* FXAA, SSAO and Bloom post processing effects
* MD5 based animation system
