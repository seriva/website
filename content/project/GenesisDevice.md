## About

A project started in early 2007 insprired by the Elder Scrolls: Oblivion and Skyrim. The goal is/was to create an engine with similar capabilities while in the process creating some basic gameplay elements. I revisit this project every so often adding new features or improving it for nostagic reasons;)

## Features

* Multi-platform using SDL supporting Linux/Windows
* OpenGL based rendering system
* OpenAL based sound system
* Newton based physics system
* Modular shader system
* FXAA, SSAO and bloom post processing effects
* Multi-layered heightmap based terrain
* Water with reflection, refraction, waves and underwater effects
* Foliage (grass, trees, bushes rocks) with animations
* Skydome with clouds and animations
* Octree based scene management
* Forward lighting system for outdoor areas with support directional lights with projective soft-shadow
* Deferred lighting system  for indoor areas with support for spot and pointlight with soft-shadows
* Uses a set of well known content formats (MD5, OBJ and DDS) with convertors for the proprietary JSON based format 
* WIP Editor for building maps (Windows only)
* JSON based system for ingame HUD
