Welcome to my little corner of the web! As you might have guessed my name is Luuk van Venrooij and I`m an avid developer both in my professional and personal life.


Professionally I have worked on many different projects ranging from game engines, mobile apps (Android, iOS) and large industrial asset management systems. Currently I'm a fulltime opensource developer on the [Epiphany Platform](https://github.com/epiphany-platform/epiphany), an industrialized automation of Kubernetes and additional services.

My private projects mostly center arround graphics and games using OpenGL/WebGL. On this website I showcase some of these and ramble about other interest using Twitter:)

If you have any questions, suggestions or comments feel free to <a href="#" onclick="javascript:Email()">contact me.</a>.
